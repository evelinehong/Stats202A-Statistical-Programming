## Introduction 

Hello everyone! Welcome to the final project! In the previous 10 week, we finished 8 homeworks including many important algorithm in statistic learning. In the final project, we want you to finish the last part and organize all your previous code. Here is the details. 

1. R coding for Lasso solution path based on coordinate descent and epsilon-boosting.
    - See detail in Lasso.R 
    - Plot 3 graphs, the error (by coordinate descent without epsilon-boosting), the error(with epsilon-boosting) and the solution path. 
    - Turn 3 graphs into pdf with corresponding comments.
2. Python coding of NN using class.
    - follow the instruction in the IPython notebook `part2.ipynb`.
    - You may required to install required package. If you have pip, run : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 
    - Actually this part is not hard in coding but hard in reading codes. Try to understand the input and output for every function and search google for help if needed.
3. Play with TF and PyTorch. 
   - Please read and run these two jupyter notebook attached.
   - Write corresponding comments on every key function(e.g. loss function, gradient, input, network structure, output). 
   - Try to change different hyper-parameter and network structure to have better accuracy (>97% on mnist). After each notebook, write visualization (e.g. classification result, accuracy through epoch, different accuracy through different setting).
   - Google Colab is recommended if you do not have any experience on installing tensorflow and pytorch. Please refer to the tutorial link in these two jupyter book.
4. Organize all the code written and write brief memo. 
   - Combine them into 2 files, 1 for python and 1 for R. Make input and output consistent.
   - For each function, briefly explain the background and key ideas in coding. Also, specify what is input and what is output.
   - Markdown or Latex is recommended. 

## Submit file structure 

1. One pdf report. Please convert ipynb, markdown and latex to pdf. Combine 4 parts into 1 single pdf and use VERY BIG TITLES to split parts.
   1. 2 graphs from lasso.R and its comment
   2. convert `part2.ipynb` to pdf 
   3. convert `pytorch.ipynb` and `tensorflow.ipynb` to pdf
   4. The brief memo including every function you write in previous hw.
2. All the code with the same structure provided in template. Remember to delete dataset folder  `./stats202a/datasets`.
3. In addition, 2 files include all your previous code for part 4.
4. DO NOT USE ZIP.

## Grading 

1. For each part, the max pts is (40, 40, 10, 10), each part can have 5pts bouns for prefect job. The total percentage of final is 30%. 
2. Failure to submit any part of the code will result to zero for that part even though I may not check your code. 
3. If you cannot finish all the part, write as much as possible. I will give many partial scores. 
4. DDL is next Sunday 12.15 11:59PM. It is a hard DDL. 



Good luck~
